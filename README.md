## üöÄ Installation

Getting this project up and running on your local machine is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

*   **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the project to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samueltuoyo15/Object-Detect-Agent.git
    cd Object-Detect-Agent
    ```

*   **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the project directory and install all necessary packages using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

*   **Run Development Server:**
    Once dependencies are installed, you can launch the development server to view the application in your browser. This command will typically open the app at `http://localhost:5173/` (or a similar port).

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

*   **Build for Production:**
    To create an optimized production build of the application, run the following command. The compiled files will be located in the `dist` directory.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## üí° Usage

Once the application is running, it will automatically attempt to access your device's camera.

1.  **Grant Camera Permission:** Upon loading, your browser will prompt you to grant camera access. Please allow this for the application to function correctly.
2.  **Live Detection:** The application will display your live camera feed. In real-time, it will draw bounding boxes around detected objects and label them with their predicted class and confidence score.
3.  **Result Display:** A panel next to the video feed will list all currently detected objects, along with their confidence percentages, providing a clear overview of what the model is identifying.
4.  **Visibility Management:** The application intelligently pauses object detection and camera stream when the browser tab is not active, conserving resources. Detection automatically resumes when the tab is brought back into focus.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Object Detection:** Leverages the COCO-SSD model via TensorFlow.js to perform live object detection directly in the browser.
*   **Webcam Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with your device's webcam to capture live video streams for analysis.
*   **Dynamic Bounding Boxes:** Draws precise bounding boxes and labels around detected objects on a canvas overlay for clear visual feedback.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Displays the confidence percentage for each detected object, providing insight into the model's certainty.
*   **Resource Management:** Automatically pauses the camera stream and detection process when the tab is hidden, optimizing performance and battery life.
*   **Type-Safe Development:** Built with TypeScript for enhanced code quality, maintainability, and early error detection.
