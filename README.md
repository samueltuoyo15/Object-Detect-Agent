# Real-time Object Detection Agent üì∏

Dive into the world of AI with the **Object Detection Agent**, a minimalist yet powerful web application designed to identify objects in real-time using your device's camera. Built with TypeScript and leveraging the robust capabilities of TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model, this project offers a dynamic and interactive experience for recognizing common objects right in your browser.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to see AI in action? Follow these steps to get the Object Detection Agent running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samueltuoyo15/Object-Detect-Agent.git
cd Object-Detect-Agent
```

Once inside the project directory, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server and launch the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your browser should automatically open the application, usually at `http://localhost:5173/`. If it doesn't, navigate there manually.

## üí° Usage

Upon launching the application, you'll be prompted to grant camera access. Allow access to begin real-time object detection.

*   **Camera Feed**: You'll see a live video feed from your camera.
*   **Object Detection**: The AI model continuously analyzes the video stream for recognizable objects.
*   **Bounding Boxes**: Detected objects will be highlighted with green bounding boxes drawn directly on the video feed.
*   **Results Display**: A list of detected objects, along with their confidence scores (e.g., "person - 98.50%"), will be displayed next to the video.
*   **No Detection Message**: If no recognizable objects are found, a "No Recognizable Object Detected" message will appear.
*   **Background Handling**: The application intelligently pauses detection and the camera stream when the browser tab is not active, reloading upon focus to ensure optimal performance and resource management.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Object Detection**: Instantly identifies objects from your live camera feed.
*   **Browser-based Interface**: Runs entirely in the browser, requiring no complex server-side setup.
*   **AI-Powered**: Utilizes the pre-trained COCO-SSD model via TensorFlow.js for accurate object recognition.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects for clear visualization.
*   **Confidence Scores**: Displays the probability of detection for each identified object.
*   **Responsive Camera Management**: Automatically handles camera stream and detection based on tab visibility, optimizing performance.
*   **Modern Web Stack**: Built with TypeScript and Vite for a robust and efficient development experience.
